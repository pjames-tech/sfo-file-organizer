## What Does It Do?

The File Organizer automatically sorts your files into folders:

| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Photos & Images (.jpg, .png)  | 📷 Images      |
| Documents (.pdf, .docx, .txt) | 📄 Documents   |
| Videos (.mp4, .mkv)           | 🎬 Videos      |
| Music (.mp3, .wav)            | 🎵 Audio       |
| Zip files (.zip, .rar)        | 📦 Archives    |
| Programs (.exe, .msi)         | ⚙️ Executables |
| Code files (.py, .js)         | 💻 Code        |
